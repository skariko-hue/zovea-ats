Creat a completly designed and  integrable Applicant Tracking System in Dutch for Zovea Talent. It should include basic client information like name of clinique, adress, chambers of commerce number and contact person details. It should also include an interface which allows you to connect candidates to Cliniques with the following processes: first interview, trial day and last offer. For the candidates I should be able to enter their job wishes and salary rate and location. Their should also be an option to put the candidate on inactive and also on the term placed by us connecting to the clinique in regard. It should have an option to add documents to the clients profile like agreements and contracts which can be directly emailed to the client. Also include a portal for the client to login and see updates regarding candidate journey and documents regarding their profile. The client should be able to see the candidates cv and availablity for interviews and trial days. The candidate should also have a similar portal but they are not able to see cliniques until linked with them via a journey, interview or trial day.  There should also be a main login for the owner of the system and they have all access to change data. Share the html with me and give me access to the system.
